Simulation code consists of a main function, 3 classess, and file I/O functions. The MCsim class is used to perform the simulation, the HRing class represents a helicene ring in the chain of rings being simulated, and the Vector3D class represents a 3-component vector (x, y, z) and provides useful operations for 3-component vectors.
